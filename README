wilite is a simple mobile XMPP client written in HTML and Javascript.

It uses the Strophe.js [1] library to establish XMPP connections over HTTP,
and the jQuery Mobile [2] framework for the user interface.

To start using it, create a config.js file containing the information
for your XMPP server:

var WILITE_BOSH_URL = 'http://yourserver:5280/http-bind/';
var WILITE_DOMAIN = 'yourdomain.org';
